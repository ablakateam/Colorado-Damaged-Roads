Road Damage in Colorado Web App
## Overview

The **Road Damage in Colorado** web app allows users to submit photos of road damage along with an approximate location or intersection. The information will be stored in a database, displayed on the main page, and users can comment on individual entries without requiring registration. The goal is to make it easy for the community to report road damage and interact with the submissions.

### [Live Demo](https://coloradoroads.replit.app/)  
You can test the live version of the web app here: [Road Damage in Colorado Web App](https://coloradoroads.replit.app/).

## Main Features

### Main Screen
- A form for users to:
  - Upload a photo of road damage.
  - Enter an approximate location or intersection (no need to capture location data from the device or use GeoIP).
  - Submit the form to save the data (photo and location) into the database.
  
- Below the form:
  - Display the 6 most recent photos and locations submitted by users.
  - Include an "infinity load more" button to load additional entries without reloading the page.

### Detail Page
- When a user clicks on a photo from the main screen, they will be directed to a detailed page:
  - The page will display the full photo and location information.
  - A comment box will allow users to leave comments without needing to register.
  - Below the comment box, a list of recent comments with the date they were posted will be shown.

## Design Requirements
- The app will have a modern and visually appealing design.
- A trendy color scheme and contemporary fonts will be used to ensure an attractive user interface.

## Admin Area (In Progress)
- An admin panel will be added in future versions of the app to allow for submission moderation, reporting, and management. This is still under development and not yet available.
